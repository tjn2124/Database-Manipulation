mymdb-lookup.c

A C program that takes a database of Mdb structs that contain a message 
and a name. mdb-add.c stores that database as a list of nodes containing Mdb 
struct records. The Makefile links to a separate library I created
(contained in the List-Library Repo)  which creates a list structure and 
functions that help manipulate the list of node structs that can hold void data types.
